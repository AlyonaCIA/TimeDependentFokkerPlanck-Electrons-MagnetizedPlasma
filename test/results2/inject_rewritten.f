      subroutine inject
c
c     Subroutine to handle the injection of an electron distribution into the simulation.
c
c     The initially injected electron distribution is a Gaussian in space but turns into a delta 
c     function in space, isotropic in pitch angle, and a power-law in energy, plus being a 
c     triangular shape pulse of 2 seconds in duration.
c
      implicit none
c
c     Declare variables and arrays
c     ...
      real*8 delta, e0, sa, ft0, t
      integer*4 ie, imu, itau
c     ...
c     Set initial parameters and values
c     ...
      delta = 0.05
      e0 = 10.
      sa = 3.
c     ...
c     Time-stepping loop to define the injected electron distribution
      do 10 itau=1,ntau
c       Logic to define ft0 in terms of the time t using conditionals
c       ...
c       Nested loops to iterate through the energy, tau, and mu dimensions
c       to apply the electron distribution
        do 20 ie=1,ne
          do 30 imu=1,nmu
c           Define the injected electron distribution using variables and parameters
c           ...
          30 continue
        20 continue
      10 continue
      end
